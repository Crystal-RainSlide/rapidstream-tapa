TAPA Output Files
=================

TAPA generates various output files depending on the input options provided.
This documentation outlines the structure and contents of these files.

XO Object
---------

The primary output of `tapa` is an XO object, which serves as input for the
Vitis `v++` compiler for bitstream generation.

In fact, the XO object is a ``.zip`` file, which can be ``unzip``\ ped to see
the contents. The XO object contains the RTLs corresponding to the C++ source
code and configuration files with metadata about the design.

You may unzip the XO object, modify the RTLs, and zip it back to pass it to
``v++`` to customize the design to your needs.

Intermediate Files
------------------

When the `--work-dir` option is used (recommended), TAPA saves intermediate
files to the specified directory. The structure is as follows:

.. code-block:: text

   work_dir/
   ├── cpp/
   ├── log/
   ├── tar/
   ├── hdl/
   └── graph.json

1. ``cpp/`` Directory

   - Contains C++ code for each task extracted by ``tapac``.
   - Each file is independently compiled to RTL by ``vitis_hls``.

2. ``log/`` Directory

   - Stores logs from various processing steps.
   - Includes logs from ``vitis_hls`` ``csynth_design``.

3. ``tar/`` Directory

   - Contains one or more ``.tar`` archive files.
   - Each ``.tar`` file includes the output of ``csynth_design`` for a single task.

4. ``hdl/`` Directory

   - Stores RTL files for all tasks generated by ``vitis_hls``.
   - Includes TAPA-specific infrastructure RTL.

5. ``graph.json``

   - JSON file recording all contents and metadata of the input design.
